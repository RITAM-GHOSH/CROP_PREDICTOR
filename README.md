## Deployment in VS Code

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Visual Studio Code
- Git

### Setup Instructions

#### Automatic Setup

For convenient setup, use the provided scripts:

- **On Windows**: Double-click `setup.bat` or run it from Command Prompt
- **On macOS/Linux**: Run `bash setup.sh` in Terminal

These scripts will:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Set up the proper Streamlit configuration

After running the setup script, you can start the application with:
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the application manually:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crop-fertilizer-recommendation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r dependencies.txt
   ```

   If dependencies.txt is not available, install the following packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn reportlab python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Configure the application**

   - Ensure the `.streamlit` directory contains the proper configuration files
   - For email functionality:
     - Copy `.env-example` to `.env`
     - Edit `.env` with your email credentials
     - Required variables:
       - `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address
       - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your email password or app password
       - `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server (default: smtp.gmail.com)
       - `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port (default: 587)

5. **Run the application from VS Code**

   - Open VS Code and the project folder
   - Open a terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal)
   - Make sure your virtual environment is active
   - Run the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

6. **Access the application**

   The application will be available at http://localhost:8501 by default

## VS Code Extensions

For the best development experience, install these VS Code extensions:

- **Python**: Microsoft's Python extension
- **Pylance**: Enhanced language server for Python
- **Streamlit**: Provides Streamlit-specific code snippets and support
- **Jupyter**: For working with Jupyter notebooks if needed

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `crop_recommendation_model.py`: ML model for crop prediction
- `crop_data.py`: Dataset and agricultural information
- `reportlab_pdf.py`: PDF generation functionality
- `settings.py`: Email and application settings
- `.streamlit/config.toml`: Streamlit configuration
- `setup.sh`: Setup script for macOS/Linux
- `setup.bat`: Setup script for Windows
- `dependencies.txt`: List of required packages
- `.env-example`: Template for environment variables
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the following:

- `.streamlit/config.toml`: Change theme colors, server settings
- `crop_data.py`: Add or modify crop and fertilizer information
- `reportlab_pdf.py`: Customize the PDF report format and content

## Troubleshooting

- **Port issues**: If port 8501 is already in use, Streamlit will automatically try to use another port. Check the terminal output for the URL.
- **Email configuration**: For Gmail, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" or use an App Password.
- **Dependencies**: If you encounter missing dependencies, install them with `pip install [package-name]`.
